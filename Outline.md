# IOT Workshop : Outline

## Introduction
* What is IOT (what's not IOT)
* Business Scenarios
* IOT Architecture (Devices, Gateway, Platforms, End User Apps)
* Platform Connectivity Protocols (Via Internet) - MQTT and HTTP REST
* IOT Platforms - ThingSpeak / ThingsBoard

## Node-RED
* Setting up NodeRED, Simple Workflows
* Building dashboard in Node-RED
* Quick Demo : SenseHAT simulator


## MQTT
* Overview of MQTT 
* Using commands (mosquitto_pub, mosquitto_sub) and Mobile apps
* Python examples for MQTT
* MQTT Publish & Subscribe in Node-RED

## HTTP REST
* Overview of HTTP Protocol, REST APIs
* Using curl command / postman 
* Python examples for HTTP REST
* Using HTTP REST APIs in Node-RED

## Activity
* Integrate sensors, actuators (from day-1 & day-2) with MQTT, HTTP REST operations

## Gateway
* Why do we need Gateway (Non-IP to IP, optimal IP address usage, Security & Scalability)
* Simple Gateway Demo : Arduion as End Device sending data to RaspberryPi (Gateway), which in turn publish data to IOT Platform 
* Ideas on Gateway based projects (e.g. Bridging CAN Network / Bluetooth Networks with Internet)
